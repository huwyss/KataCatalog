# KataVeryLong
Calculator for very long integers

####Requirements:####
1. Write a class VeryLong that has the method Add() that can add two big integers.
2. Write the method Subtract() that can subtract another big integer from the first.
3. Write the method Multiply() that can multiply two big integers.
4. Write the method DivideBy() that can divide a big integer by another.

####Hints:####
- You can represent a big integer with a string.
- The algorithm on how to do the calculations you can do it as if you would calculate it by hand on paper.
- Use TDD to implement.

####Requirements 2:####
1. Extend VeryLong to handle fixed point numbers with arbitrary number of digits after the point
2. Calculate Pi for 100 digits behind the point. (or 10 Million http://pi.karmona.com/)

####Hints 2:####
- Approximations of Pi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80
- And german: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreiszahl
- I implemented Pi = 3 + 4/2/3/4 - 4/4/5/6 + 4/6/7/8 - 4/8/9/10 +-...
